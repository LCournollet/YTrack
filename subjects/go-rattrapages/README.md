#### PART 1

For this project you must submit all the exercices present in the `beginner` folder.

These exercies are mandatory and constitute a grade of 9 maximum. Not enough to complete the test then.

#### PART 2

You need to complete **AT LEAST** one of the exercices presented in the `intermediate` folder.

**BE CAREFUL**, you may not pass all the test in the first part, which can result to a grade less than 9.

Then we advise you to make more than one exercice in this part.
