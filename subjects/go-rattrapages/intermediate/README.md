### MineSweeper (4 points)

*Minesweeper* is a game in which the player must find the mines according to the digit that indicates the number of mines adjacent to a square.
(A square is considered the 9 cases around a mine)

In this exercise you have to create a function `func ComputeMineSweeper(board *[][]rune)` that counts the number of adjacent mines and changes the values like the example below. The function must change the pointer, it should not return anything.
(The * in the board indicates a mine)

Example:

```
+-----+
| * * |
|  *  |
|  *  |
|     |
+-----+
```
Will become: 

```
+-----+
|1*3*1|
|13*31|
| 2*2 |
| 111 |
+-----+
```

Here is a tip to initialize the board in the main function:

``` golang

board := [][]rune{
    []rune("+-----+"),
    []rune("| * * |"),
    []rune("|  *  |"),
    []rune("|     |"),
    []rune("+-----|"),
}

```

### C3PO (4 points)

In this exercice you will need the following structures.

``` golang

type Point struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

type Robot struct {
	Fuel     int
	Position Point
}
```

The goal of this exercice is to make a `Robot` move towards a given `Destination`.
For this you will have to create:
* A global variable named `Destination` of type `Point`
* A function `func MoveRobot(robot *Robot, direction string)`.
    - The `direction` param is either "LEFT", "RIGHT", "TOP", "BOTTOM"
    - This function must change the `Position` of the robot according to the `direction`. It will also decrease the `Fuel`

    - If the `Position` approaches the `Destination`, the function will display: `I'm C3PO, computing Cyborg data`
    - If it moves away, it will display: `D2R2, where are you my boy ?...`
    - If the Robot reaches the `Destination`, it will display `D2R2, it's you my boy, that is really you !`
    - If the Robot is out of `Fuel`, it will display `Aaaaaaaah... my.. batteri..es .. a..re ... dead ....;`

### Blood and Swords (3 points +)

In this exercice you will need the following structures.

``` golang
type Point struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

type Character struct {
    Name    string
    Health  uint
    Damage  int
    IsAlive bool
    Stamina int
    Position Point
}
```

Write a programm that will wait commands on the standard input. The accepted commands are:
- LEFT
- TOP
- RIGHT
- BOTTOM
- ATTACK

At the start of the program, two `Character` must be created with random positions.

- For each command, the first `Character` only, will lose 1 `Stamina`.
- For all the commands, excepted "ATTACK", the first `Character` will move it's potision by 1 according to the direction choosen in the standard input.
- For the "ATTACK" command, the first `Character` will apply its damages to the second `Character`, only if their positions are the same.

**Particular cases**
- If the stamina reaches 0 or less, the programm will display: `I need a break...`
- If the first `Character` try to "ATTACK" but the second is not here, it will display: `[c2 name] is not here.`
- In the other case, refer to subject `Blood and Guts` (first part), and reproduce the behavior of the `Attack` function.
