### Objectives
In this project you will create a browser-based game inspired by Osu! and Frets on Fire.

### Getting started
You will need to create a public repository with the name `rhythm-frenzy`.

### Core features
- You will use a `requestAnimationFrame` recursive loop.
- HTML elements are created automatically at random intervals and move.
- When a key is pressed or a click, an element will be destroyed
- A line will be drawn using HTML, if the key is pressed when the element touches the line the element's color will change to green, else it will change to red.
- The controls must be displayed one way or another

### Bonuses
- Elements appear on different zones, each zone is associated to a different key
- Element emit a sound depending of the column when destroyed at the right time
- Elements can be of different height or radius
- The game has a duration of 1mn. A score is calculated depending on how many elements have been destroyed at the right time.

### Example
- Inspired by Guitar Hero or Frets on Fire

Have fun and good luck.
