## forum-advanced-features

### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/forum/) as the first subject.

In `forum advanced features`, you will have to implement the following features :

<!-- - You will have to create a way to notify users when their posts are :

  - liked/disliked
  - commented -->
- A registered user can add comments to a post
- All user, registered or not, can see comments

- When registered users are creating a post they can associate one or more categories to it (ex: Sport, Events, Video Games, ...).
  - The implementation and choice of the categories is up to you.

- You can create an activity page (User profil) that tracks the user own activity. In other words, a page that :
  - Shows the user created posts
  - Shows where the user left a like or a dislike
  - Shows where and what the user has been commenting. For this, the comment will have to be shown, as well as the post commented
<!-- - You have to create a section where you will be able to Edit/Remove posts and comments. -->
- You can create a post containing an image as well as text. (max size of the images to load should be 20 mb, otherwise an error message is displayed)

We encourage you to add any other additional features that you find relevant.
