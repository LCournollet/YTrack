## forum-advanced-features

### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/forum/) as the first subject.

In `forum advanced features`, you will have to implement the following features :

<!-- - You will have to create a way to notify users when their posts are :

  - liked/disliked
  - commented -->
- **Likes and Dislikes**: Only registered users will be able to like or dislike posts. The number of likes and dislikes should be visible by all users (registered or not).
- A registered user can add comments to a post
- All user, registered or not, can see comments

- When registered users are creating a post they can associate one or more categories to it (ex: Sport, Events, Video Games, ...).
  - The implementation and choice of the categories is up to you.

- You can create an activity page (User profil) that tracks the user own activity. In other words, a page that :
  - Shows the user created posts
  - Shows where the user left a like or a dislike
  - Shows where and what the user has been commenting. For this, the comment will have to be shown, as well as the post commented
<!-- - You have to create a section where you will be able to Edit/Remove posts and comments. -->
- You can create a post containing an image as well as text. (max size of the images to load should be 20 mb, otherwise an error message is displayed)
