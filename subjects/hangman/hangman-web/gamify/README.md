## hangman-web-gamify

### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://github.com/Lyon-Ynov-Campus/YTrack/tree/master/subjects/hangman/hangman-web) as the first subject.

Hangman-gamify consists in making your interface more game oriented.

You can implement other routes to help you have other interfaces representing the state of your game
For example:

- A startup page asking for you UserName and a button to start
- A losing or/and winning screen
- A button somewhere to allow the user to play again.
- A scoreboard
- A list of all letters suggested during the game.

Those are only examples, you are free to implement any features you like that can make the project look better, and feel like a real game.

This project will help you learn about:

- The basics of game interfaces.
- The basics of CSS.
- Linking CSS and HTML.
- Implemeting differents routes and templates
