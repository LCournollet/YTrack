## hangman-stickman

### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://github.com/Lyon-Ynov-Campus/YTrack/tree/master/subjects/hangman/hangman-classic) as the first subject.

In hangman-stickman you must draw in the terminal the number of attempts left, represented by a stickman
Each time you suggest a wrong letter or a wrong word, the stickman grows, until the scheme is done, and the man completely hanging.

The final result should look like the following :

```
  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
 /|\  |
 / \  |
      |
=========
```

You still have 10 attempts to complete the game.
