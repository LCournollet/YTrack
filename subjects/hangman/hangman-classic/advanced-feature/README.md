## hangman-advanced-features

### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://github.com/Lyon-Ynov-Campus/YTrack/tree/master/subjects/hangman/hangman-classic) as the first subject.

In hangman-advanced-features you can implement the following things:

- The player can suggest either a word or a letter. (A word is a string of at least two character long)
    - If the word is found the game stops
    - If not, the counter of attempts decrease by 2

- Stock the letters that are suggested by the player so the player can't propose the same letter twice.
    - You can display error message when this case happens.

### Allowed packages

- Only the [standard go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed

### Instructions

- The code must respect the [**good practices**](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/).
- We suggest you to search for the principles of a good website design.
